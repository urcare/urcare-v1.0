## üîß Configuration

### OpenAI Integration

The system automatically uses OpenAI when available:

```typescript
// Automatically detects and uses OpenAI API
const plan = await aiHealthAssistantService.generateDailyPlan(userProfile);
```

### Rule-Based Fallback

When OpenAI is unavailable, the system uses sophisticated rule-based algorithms:

```typescript
// Fallback to rule-based generation
private generateRuleBased(profile: UserHealthProfile): PersonalizedDailyPlan {
  // Comprehensive rule-based logic
  // Nutrition calculations, exercise planning, etc.
}
```

### Customization Options

You can customize various aspects of the system:

```typescript
// Modify health calculations
private calculateNutrition(profile: UserHealthProfile) {
  // Custom BMR calculations
  // Adjustable macro ratios
  // Goal-specific calorie adjustments
}

// Customize exercise recommendations
private generateExercisePlan(profile: UserHealthProfile) {
  // Age-appropriate intensity
  // Goal-specific frequency
  // Progressive overload planning
}
```

## üìä Data Models
