## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Edge Functions

Run the deployment script:
```powershell
.\deploy-phonepe-functions.ps1
```

Or deploy manually:
```bash
supabase functions deploy phonepe-create-order
supabase functions deploy phonepe-payment-status
supabase functions deploy phonepe-payment-callback
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Edge Functions > Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add all the variables listed above

### 3. Test the Integration

1. Start your application
2. Navigate to the paywall
3. Click "Pay with PhonePe"
4. You should be redirected to the PhonePe payment page
5. Complete the payment flow

## 🔄 Payment Flow

### 1. Payment Initiation
- User clicks "Pay with PhonePe" on paywall
- Frontend calls `phonepe-create-order` Edge Function
- Function creates PhonePe payment order
- User is redirected to PhonePe PayPage

### 2. Payment Processing
- User enters payment details on PhonePe
- PhonePe processes the payment
- PhonePe calls our callback URL with result

### 3. Payment Completion
- User is redirected to `/phonecheckout/result`
- Frontend checks payment status
- On success: Redirect to dashboard
- On failure: Redirect to health assessment

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Checksum Validation
- All PhonePe requests include checksum validation
- Prevents tampering with payment data

### 2. Callback Validation
- PhonePe callbacks are validated using merchant credentials
- Ensures only legitimate callbacks are processed

### 3. Environment Variables
- All sensitive data stored as environment variables
- Not exposed in client-side code

## 📊 Database Integration

### Payment Records
The integration creates records in the `payments` table with:
- User ID and plan details
- Payment amount and currency
- PhonePe transaction IDs
- Payment status and timestamps
- Request/response data for debugging

### Status Updates
- `processing` - Payment initiated
- `completed` - Payment successful
- `failed` - Payment failed or cancelled

## 🔍 Error Handling

### Frontend Errors
- Network errors with retry options
- Invalid payment data validation
- User-friendly error messages

### Backend Errors
- PhonePe API error handling
- Database operation error handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## 🧪 Testing

### Sandbox Testing
- Use provided test credentials
- Test all payment scenarios
- Verify callback handling

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Update all credentials to production values
- [ ] Change `PHONEPE_ENV` to `PRODUCTION`
- [ ] Update `FRONTEND_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Test with real payment methods
- [ ] Monitor logs for any issues

## 📱 User Experience

- Implement additional payment methods

## 📞 Support

### Debugging
1. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
