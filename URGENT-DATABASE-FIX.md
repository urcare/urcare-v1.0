# 🚨 URGENT: Apply Database Fix

## The Issue

You're still getting 404 errors for the `health_scores` table because the database fix hasn't been applied yet.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard

- Open your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to **SQL Editor**

### 2. Run the Database Fix

- Copy the contents of `fix-all-issues.sql`
- Paste it into the SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"** to execute

### 3. Verify the Fix

After running the script, you should see:

- ✅ No more 404 errors in console
- ✅ Health scores table created
- ✅ Default data inserted for your user

## What This Fixes:

- ✅ Creates missing `health_scores` table
- ✅ Creates `daily_activities` table
- ✅ Creates `weekly_summaries` table
- ✅ Sets up proper RLS policies
- ✅ Inserts default health score data
- ✅ Creates backup health plan function

## Expected Results:

After applying the fix:

- No more 404 errors in browser console
- Health scores will load properly
- All app features will work correctly

## ⚠️ Important:

The `PlanDetails.tsx` error has been fixed in the code, but you still need to apply the database fix to resolve the 404 errors.
