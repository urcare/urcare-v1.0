# Plan Activities Function - Health-Focused Update

## ‚úÖ **Successfully Updated**

I've completely transformed the `plan-activities` Supabase function to be more health-focused and realistic, similar to your wellness advisor prompt.

## üîÑ **Key Changes Made:**

### 1. **Enhanced Prompt Structure**
- **Health Warnings**: Starts with "‚ö†Ô∏è MEDICAL CONSULTATION REQUIRED"
- **Realistic Constraints**: Acknowledges work hours, sleep patterns, and health conditions
- **Indian Vegetarian Support**: Automatically detects vegetarian/vegan diets and suggests appropriate foods
- **Difficulty-Based Workouts**: Adjusts intensity based on selected plan (Gentle/Balanced/Intensive)

### 2. **Comprehensive User Profile Analysis**
- **Location**: Uses country, state, district information
- **Health Concerns**: Sleep hours, chronic conditions, work schedule analysis
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Smoking, drinking, routine flexibility
- **Medical Information**: Blood group, medications, allergies, critical conditions

### 3. **Enhanced Response Structure**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dailySchedule": [...],
  "healthWarnings": [
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Sleep pattern analysis: X hours vs recommended 7-8 hours",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Work schedule: 9:00 to 17:00 may be unsustainable",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Consult doctor before starting any fitness program"
  ],
  "scheduleConflicts": [
    "Check for time conflicts between wake, work, workout, and sleep times"
  ],
  "disclaimer": "Medical consultation recommended...",
  "meta": {
    "healthFocused": true,
    "userProfile": {...}
  }
}
```

### 4. **Detailed Meal Instructions**
- **Step-by-step cooking instructions**
- **Nutritional breakdown** (calories, protein, carbs, fats)
- **Indian vegetarian dishes** (dal, roti, sabzi, paneer, dahi, etc.)
- **Quantity specifications** for each ingredient

### 5. **Smart Difficulty Adaptation**
- **Gentle Plans**: 15-20 min routines, stress relief focus
- **Balanced Plans**: 20-30 min routines, balanced strength/cardio
- **Intensive Plans**: 30-45 min routines, intensive conditioning

## üéØ **Features Added:**

3. **Medical Disclaimers**: Emphasizes need for professional consultation
4. **Cultural Adaptation**: Indian vegetarian cuisine support

6. **Difficulty Scaling**: Adapts to selected plan intensity

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

   ```bash
   npx supabase functions deploy plan-activities
   ```

2. **Test with different plan difficulties**:
   - Try Gentle, Balanced, and Intensive plans
   - Verify health warnings appear
   - Check meal suggestions match diet type

3. **Frontend Integration**:
