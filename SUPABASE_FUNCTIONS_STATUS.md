# âœ… Supabase Functions Setup Complete

## Successfully Deployed Functions

1. âœ… **generate-health-plan** - Main health plan generation
2. âœ… **generate-health-plan-simple** - Simple fallback plan generation
3. âœ… **test-basic** - Basic test function for debugging
4. âœ… **generate-ai-health-coach-plan** - AI health coach plans
5. âœ… **create-razorpay-order** - Payment order creation
6. âœ… **verify-razorpay-payment** - Payment verification

## Environment Variables Configured âœ…

All required environment variables are properly set in your Supabase project:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` âœ…
- `SUPABASE_URL` âœ…
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` âœ…
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` âœ…
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Supabase CLI Installation âœ…

- Supabase CLI was already installed as dev dependency
- No need for global installation (which was causing errors)

### 2. Function Deployment âœ…

- All functions successfully deployed to remote Supabase project
- Fixed syntax error in `generate-ai-health-coach-plan` function
- Functions are now accessible via `supabase.functions.invoke()`

### 3. Docker Issue Resolved âœ…

- Docker not needed for function deployment (only for local development)
- Functions deployed directly to remote Supabase project
- Local development can work without Docker by using remote functions

### 4. Environment Configuration âœ…

- All necessary environment variables already configured
- Functions can access OpenAI API and Supabase services
- CORS headers properly configured for web app access

## How Functions Work Now

Your app calls functions like this:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke(
  "generate-health-plan",
  {
    method: "POST",
    body: {},
  }
);
```

The functions are now deployed and should work properly!

## Next Steps

1. **Test the application** - Functions should now work in your app
2. **Monitor function logs** - Check Supabase Dashboard â†’ Functions â†’ Logs
3. **Optional: Install Docker** - For local function development (not required for production)
