# 🔍 API Key Debug Summary

## ✅ **Issues Identified & Fixed:**

1. **406 Error** - Fixed by handling development user authentication
2. **UUID Format Error** - Fixed by using valid UUID for development user
3. **Authentication Bypass** - Added development mode detection

## ⚠️ **Current Issue: 500 Internal Server Error**

The Edge Function is now getting past authentication but failing with a 500 error. This suggests:

### **Possible Causes:**

1. **OpenAI API Key Issue** - Even though you said it's there, it might not be accessible
2. **Database Save Error** - The plan save operation might be failing
3. **AI Generation Error** - The OpenAI API call might be failing

## 🔧 **Next Steps to Debug:**

### **Option 1: Check Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lvnkpserdydhnqbigfbz)
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions** → **generate-comprehensive-health-plan**
3. Check the **Logs** tab to see the actual error message
4. Look for any error details in the function logs

### **Option 2: Verify API Key Configuration**

1. In Supabase Dashboard → **Settings** → **Edge Functions**
2. Verify the environment variable:
   - **Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Should start with `sk-`
3. Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters

### **Option 3: Test API Key Directly**

If you have the API key locally, you can test it:

```bash
# Add to your .env file:
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Then run:
node test-database-direct.js
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix:**

Once the API key issue is resolved, you should see:

- ✅ Edge Function returns 200 status
- ✅ Real GPT-4 generated health plans
- ✅ Plans saved to database successfully
- ✅ No more fallback to mock data

## 📊 **Current Status:**

- ✅ Database tables exist and are accessible
- ✅ RLS policies are working
- ✅ Development user handling is fixed
- ✅ Edge Function authentication bypass is working
- ⚠️ **API key or database save operation is failing** (500 error)

## 🚨 **Most Likely Issue:**

The OpenAI API key might not be properly configured in the Supabase Edge Functions environment variables, or there might be an issue with the database save operation.

**Check the Supabase Dashboard logs for the exact error message!**
